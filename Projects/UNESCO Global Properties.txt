UNESCO Global Properties

Global Properties will be defined as follows: 

A set of Domains which no entity has any power or right upon, limiting territory access solely on its purpose and two main features as follows:


Purpose:
-Such global public set compromises to share equally among the human species all of its contents, being, as denoted by a definition, the prime option for
-academic research content sharing; material property conservation: such as historical monuments, material possessions, land delimitations; cultural 
-practices studies and documentation, together with cultural manifestation itself.


Main Feature One, The Intelligent Uploader:

-Any entity or individual is expected to have the compromise to upload domains onto the Global Property Domain. The process does need further investigation,
-although follows a basic idea as suggested in this document:

-One such uploader utilises the Block Chain Technology to validate their upload suggestion;
-Via "Group Mining", namely, validation through mass poll, the upload attempt inserted in a Block may be accepted or rejected;
-Through the contributions of such block, once approved by the mass poll, returns in form of Peace Coin or alike are well ranged around.

-The upload requires that the Public Key and Original Key of such domain collapse into an UNESCO key, from which two new keys are generated:
-Firstly, the UNESCO Original Key is one such key that remains intact over long periods of iteration, and it's main purpose is to be conservated by the Domain;
-Secondly, the UNESCO Public Key, which can be used by any elegible individual or entity for any purpose, limited only to non-profitable trades.


Main Feature Two, Free Access to Download:

-As stated prior to this topic, the UNESCO Public Key allows copies to Public Domains from UNESCO Domain, such as digital access to:
-Monument Imagery; Music which had their licenses expired due to time limit, thus being cultural property; Broad Academic Research Publications, etc.


Why it matters?

-As time passes, capitalism deepens it's roots onto intellectual, historical, cultural property, only turning into elegible public access domains once a large
-amount of time passes.

-Through donations of Domains, the access to such properties is easened, while suggesting a novel approach to common knowledge creation and dissemination.

-Being a public domain, the maintenance of knowledge and cultures on the iminence of extintion can be prevented, while such knowledge can enjoy plasticity
-for future researches. As an example, the preservation of Buddhist teachings and researches on the adaptation of Buddhism to Contemporary Technological life.

-Overall, it aims to reduce knowledge maldistribution and looks far into the future to greatly increase the productivity and collaboration within Human Society.

-May contribute to the creation of a novel society structure.

UNESCO Global Properties > Monk Fork (Name is not yet catchy enough, improvements inquired)

Following the concept of a Global Property as:
-Domains in which neither the Private or Public domain may exert power upon;
-One such universe that allows for integration of Humanity as species and further fuel cooperation between different parties towards the same goal.

To sustain intellectual knowledge in the form of practice and technique, abroad, subjective, natural or abstract manifestations such as culture may be maintained
through the constant development and research.

Base case, to serve as inspiration: recently, Drunk Style Kung-Fu witnessed their near extintion, prevented by young practitioners who could keep the crucial factors
that differentiate this art from many others.

Towards the development of new fields, a suggestion:

Monk: a fork class from the graduation process.
Purpose: cultivates arts and practices of a specific line during long periods of time.
Requirements: graduation and the witness of a Master Monk, with their consent.

Example: Master(Monk) of Barbecue; Monk of Heema Sword Fighting; Monk of Buddhism.

Through the cooperation of Masters(Degree), Doctors(Degree), Masters(Monk) and Monks(Monk), projects within a field can be better implemented on practical and
theoretical ends.

Furthermore, in Japanese teachings, Ikigai (生き甲斐) or "Living Will" is a philosophy in which one attains meaningfulness and fulfillment from their 
lifestyle. It is composed by four indexes:
-Duty: One's offering to the world;
-Passion;
-Expertise: Domain of Masterfulness;
-Health & Gold: Obtention of essential resources to live or money.

Not the least, other factors may come to analysis:
-Zen;
-Righteousness;
-State of Mind;
-Relationships;
-Others.


By definition, a Monk attains completion on three of their domains.
-A Monk must seek mastery;
-A Monk is passionate;
-A Monk's duty is fulfilled as tradition is not only maintained, but improved.

The last one is Health and Gold, which is the next step towards full integration of a Monk based cultural and technical studies in future societies.
